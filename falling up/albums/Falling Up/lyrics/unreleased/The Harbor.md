The Harbor: 

Follow me
I’m going down
I’m going down
Harbor and hide (?) ||  Hovering high (?)
The sea to earth mine.
Where I’ll climb again

Into the night
Burn wild fires
Wild fires burning down

Of those that I know
And all that I hope
All that I hope
Is you will run

Maybe there’s a place for me in this
Maybe there’s a life I shouldn’t miss
But I can barely keep my eyes awake
Zooming down the unknown

Fireworks
Above the sky
Above the sky again
I’ll spin out
My motor ran down 
And you are going down
