The Path: 

Cloud shaper, moving above,
They kept riding till the light was gone,
Climb over, climb the fences,
In the summer there’ll be sleeping dogs

Hold quiet, holding your breath,
Walk sideways, they won’t hear the steps,
Chlorine waters, waving in gold,
Caught reflection from the swinging bulbs

There is not a place for us to hide,
It’s blocked the gates and shut our eyes,
And in the garden, poison pours into the ventilation

Lay down angels into the beds,
Next to the highways where the great gods sped,
Grey sky coastal, mystery moon,
Turn the star shapes as it lights the room

Some of us are right where we should stand,
So when the switch is flipped we’ll land,
Where all the others they will spin,
Because the world begins again…

Hall light on, turn it off now,
Walk the carpets so it makes no sound,
Cloud shaper, moving outside,
Storm will gather in the summer night
