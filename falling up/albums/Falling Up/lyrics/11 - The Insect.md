One moment long is a moment too long to know
There was a sun, but it dropped from the sky before long.
Evaline
I’ll take the fall for you, my angel
Out on the streets there are headlights
I’ll take the fall for you my angel, now I’m out to sea

If I am, if I am without you here, then I’m without you here

Into the grey, with the birds spinning up in the lays

I made a song in the fathoming vows of our love
Evaline

In your room, some summer you’ll lie and I’ll fly though your window...
