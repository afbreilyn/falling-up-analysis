FLARES
One by one, all the years will pass you
And you will see the flame start to die
And you know, that all the things they asked you
Started making sense about the lies

Come to cold, there are little secrets
Someone has a figuring mind
And you know that all of us are with you
If you have a hiding place in mind

And they lit a fire, they are coming down there
And they lit a fire, they will come to find you
If it leads to lies, they will come to find you when you’re old

One by one, they will start to pass you
You will see your legs start to slow
There they go, they’re hiding next to lampposts
They’re thinner than we’d all hope to know

They will find her
But I don’t know the man
They’re all liars

Let them know that you can float
Turn around and rise up
