The Woodworker:

When you’re a bird you can fly over highways
When you come down, they will be gone
They all ran as fast as they could

You’re a bird, over ten thousand life times
But only one time, I’ll spin you around
Under the lights and the orchestra plays

And I wait in the shivering night
Somewhere a voice spoke inside
And you climb through the window outside
And you told me to search for you there in the Mystery

Among these thieves, you do not belong
Beneath the twilight, you are floating on
And I will lose contact, then I will lose balance
And they will just watch me

When you’re a bird, you can see through the future
There is a field that looks like the sea
And we’re in a boat on a fiery breeze
Then I said “When you’re a bird, you will see others like you.”
You said, “If that is true, I’ll someday return.”
But the wind picked up and I couldn’t hear...
