Typhoon:

The things that you hear are the things that are here forever now
And the worse that I write are the words that they don’t want you to hear Because the floor in the house they were born has a space under the boards And the space is a place that their bodies will lay forevermore

They were speaking in voices hushed and whispered, I found out
They were making their plans before I entered, I found out
So they’re waiting for my shaking hand on the door to just go down 
Now they’re following me to the ends of the sea so that I don’t tell

No, what kind of life is this?

So the steps that I took went around so that I could let them know
That I just want to be where the wind and the sea will be my own
But the fear that they thought would descend in the night to everyone
Was the fear that they pushed me to feel so I wouldn’t tell anyone

In the North 4244, would you please stop following me
To the left of the street through the door with the scratches in the screen
In the hall there’s a glow from a light that’s below the copier
And the prints can be found on the ground with the ultravioleter...
