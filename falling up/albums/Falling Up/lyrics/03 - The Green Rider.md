The Green Rider:

Soon enough the room begins to spin
And all the way into the drain goes the rest of it
But far beyond the space between the walls
They couldn’t find the stewardess
I hope you know they won’t forget

It runs into my veins, I’m chlorinating up
And up above, the emanation of the son
Who thinks he’s got something to prove
And we’re so scared of it

I defy you, keeper of the dying, I defy you
Spinning in the night into our bedrooms
And telling us it’s over, I defy you

Now quiet in the darkness we will wait
One by one our bodies start to to seize
But take my hand our lead of mine of Mystery
Don’t be afraid of it, I’ve got a plan

And down into the cove and opal of your heart
To take the key you swallowed at the start,
Unlock the space that lies between the walls and run on home

I defy you, keeper of the dying, you are unknown
She is on her way to see the Mystery
She will be the queen and she’ll defy you...
