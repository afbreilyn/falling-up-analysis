In The Woodshop:

So be brave, I know there are echoes
And I fall down into the shadows
But one day this place will be empty
And the cold will come

Above my head, they’ll fly
With their lives that are more than mine
Reach out my hands to light
And feel life that is more

So be brave, outside there are dangers
I might fall down into the ages
I might stall out with all the stars off
But for you, I’ll go...
