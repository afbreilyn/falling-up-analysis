Rangers: 

It came through the upstairs blinds like an apparition
Like it didn’t know that I was in the room, but it’s obvious to me
I’ll cut the outside line and change the combination
And have the Intern enter numbers in the gate, that only she will ever see

Blue light, rangers, coming down the road
Clouds are changing, swallowing whole
The backyard border, so I can’t see the children’s swings

Closed up, woodshop, guarded with guns
Sister, upstairs, hiding the funds
And once she finds a place, she will be running

Because once I blow the breaker
It will blind you like you won’t believe

Into the Intern’s room, I’ll enter through the window
And the wind will stir up everything around
But for a moment we will hold
No they will never cease, forever they’ll remember
She says, no matter just how far they’ll take her down
She will never break the code

Moon dog, madness, sniffing in the breeze
Down in the basement, I’m swallowing keys
There is a low light glass trap that I can roll out of

Chlorine waters, waving in red
Some forging father’s signature penned
And when they find the fuse, they will be running

Blown up wood shop, and all that they find
Are parts of guards that offered their lives
So when we move down hallways, we won’t be discovered...
