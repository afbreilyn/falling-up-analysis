Wild Bird:

Come down here behind the hour, the day turns to gold
Follow my signal to sleep, you’ll never grow old
Oh no, a flourish when the lights off
A sound outside your window
Now brace yourself into the night

All of us, all of us, all of us, we’ll take shelter now
All of us, all of us, all of us, we’ve lost ourselves

Come down from up above, you, down the the drainpipe you will slide And see them walk beneath you, see them walk beneath the ives

And found here behind the wall, someone left it on
Surrounded sorrow in breach, it severed the phones
Oh no! The line placed in the siding
Will find out where we’re hiding
Protect the kids, they’ve come inside...
