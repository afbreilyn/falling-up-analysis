Flora:

I ride all night under the neon bend
Into the bluing light of the core
The ship went up into the water rings
and the earth sings, and the earth sings—

So they walk on water, so they take your eyes
Then they call you daughter, then they hypnotize you
Then they fall like lightening out across your bedroom walls

Sons and Daughters, turn your heads to the sea
Gods and angels, turn your heads to the sea

Now they’re moving down the hallways
And they’re hiding in the night shade
And they’re waiting in the dream places
Now they’re coming down the hallways

Run down there on the moonlight stairs
And you are calling my name
Cold and creaking, the kitchen sink
And you are calling my name
Just beyond the silver lawn
The fog sits on the lake
So pass the poison and hear those voices
And they’re all calling my name

Take shelter now into the underground
Lie on the wooden floors in the dark
And hold your breathe, reach for their hands you left
Reach for their hands, somehow reach for their hands

But it’s too late father, you have come too late
It’s your son and daughter, and your daughter’s fate
She is moving on to where the gully’s deep in green and golden glades

Then he made a circle with his shaking hands
Then he built a chamber made of glass
So then he could see the wires from the blurry lens
Then he used a current so the spins began
Then she rose like fire, then she rose again,
Then she turned her eyes to see the ship’s fins—
They are rising upward to the rings again...
