Hydro:

I set it all on fire, it burned away in the night
Watching with eyes so tired, the orange and the blue arise
Then I sped off on a motorcycle, like everything you dreamed
I’ll create a universe that you can barely see

Inside or outside corner in the night
The coroner hides underneath the stairway
Where the birds spin sticks in the corridors
Don’t tell the others
The cider house side corner in the night
It’s poison, they are boarding up the windows
One down and you it’s going to slip
So don’t tell the others


I built a wooden backdrop
I made it look awfully real
I set it up in the wood shop and lit it electric teal
Then coughed up just a little blood
It splashed into my hand
Please run and get father now
Because I’m thinking this is bad...
