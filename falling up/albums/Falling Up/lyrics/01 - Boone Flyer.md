Boone Flyer: 

They're riding away, stirring up dust in the light
They found a place with none of us
But the first thing she said sounded peculiar and strained
Like she couldn't believe the words that were shaping the outer lines

Just then the walls opened, just as they promised not to flee
Their plans were turned around and all the little cuts will bleed

Then they ran through the room, panic was blazing in blue
Like the blue from the lights came through as they flew past the overturned chairs
And then she leapt above, a silhouette hallowed in light
Night light shimmering dust that followed when all of the red beams turned at him

Father, where have you gone?
Mother, what have I done?

She said I swallowed keys, what have you done to keep us in the dark?
Now they're breaking through and I don't think that we can hold them off
All these lies, I'm losing count and my head is spinning
Let's close our eyes and count slow, and all of this will soon be gone

Then they ran through the room, panic was blazing in blue
Like the blue from the lights came through as they flew past the overturned chairs
And then she leapt above, a silhouette hallowed in light
Night light shimmering dust that followed when all of the red beams turned at him

Called on the phone a tracing line that ran through you and back to me
I can't believe your nerves to think that I was in the room
Known found and framed love
I dreamt that I had chopped the hands that fed
Colby hold your breath, it's quick, now good luck...

Then they ran through the room, panic was blazing in blue
Like the blue from the lights came through as they flew past the overturned chairs
And then she leapt above, a silhouette hallowed in light
Night light shimmering dust that followed when all of the red beams turned at him
