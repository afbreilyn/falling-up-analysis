I woke inside an avalanche
The floor is caving under me
A helicopter's resonating sound
I heard before the drop
Was proof of semiconic odds
That my heart below was fluttering

And in the darkest hour, I still believe in lights
And when I'm losing color, I still believe in lights
It's flashing sharp, now don't be afraid
Uncage your heart, now don't be afraid

The nearest house along the street
Where waves are hushing through the trees
Are swimming me to sleep
Cause even when the moon is down
And the power lines are taken out
The helicopter's sounding out

They all said I lost hope
But I believe you're calling me home
I believe your love has no bounds
I believe my heart is on fire
I believe my heart is uncaged
