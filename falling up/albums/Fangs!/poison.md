lots of references to poison, and also includes assumed references to the poison or its effects

"fell quick to the snow"
"spinning room its getting dark" / "spinning circles"
"turns us pale"

also I put "poisson" referencing here from [[10 - THE SIDEWINDER FLUX]] but I would not put it past Jessy to actually be making some kind of pun / double meaning to referencing the french word for fish.
