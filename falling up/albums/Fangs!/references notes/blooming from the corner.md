Blooming from the corner - an excerpt from a first draft of "A Dimmer Mars", November 2007

---

So far as I can tell from research, this thing called "A Dimmer Mars" just does not exist (on the internet that is).  I guess it's a Jessy project and that's why he knows what was in its first draft?  But WHY would that be important enough to call out as a footnote??
