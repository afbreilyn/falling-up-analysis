~ BLOOMING FROM THE CORNER

You're on your own now
Dressed in armour
If you run faster you'll forget

They walked along the walls
It was strange enough just to cause an itch
To lie right through my teeth
Except for my situation
My love, I saw your war
In the casting call
On the way to Forum A
And dazzled flies and flying lines
I know you never left the room, I know you

You're on your own now
Dressed in armour
If you run faster you'll forget

The strayers bite their tongues
Cause they feel the tingling violence in their lungs
But I was forced to speak, proclaiming Golden shapes
They hissed out the window, the finger princed a royal colour
Then I heard several gasps: "tell him to slither out!"

Down, down down
Where are the stirrings of old?
I knew you had to last

Your on your own now
Dressed in armour
If you run faster you'll forget

How strange that our character is running from the very people who sent him away...
It must be those that walk on the walls, those wall walkers put on a sick and frightful display...
