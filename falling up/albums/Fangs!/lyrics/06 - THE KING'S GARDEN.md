[[The King | THE KING]]'S GARDEN

The sky has scrapers now
The streets are made of clothes
Embroidered on every single [[sleeve]]

Some of us have seen
The [[golden arrows]] [[poised]]
Arc across the [[plaints]]
Turns us pale

Some of us have seen
The [[golden arrows]] [[poised]]
Arc across the [[plaints]]
[[poison|Turns us pale]]

--

So this is where the shapes begin to drip
Her drunk teeth fluttering in the wind
