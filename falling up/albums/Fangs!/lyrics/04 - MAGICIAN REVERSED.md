The King has made a plan
He was playing with her hair
He couldn't tell if what he felt was violence speaking out
The bright lit [[discoveratory 1]] was absently loud
It made her squirm, she said-

"War, I never knew your hands could move so quick
Your golden arrows sing
Your golden arrows sing
I'll format your lips."

Don't ever speak of stars
If you formed from different parts
Cause you know I lied there drunk that night
With the armour at my side
I left it for several seconds
But it's just enough to tear my spine, I said-

"War, I never knew your hands could move so quick
Your golden arrows sing
Your golden arrows sing
I'll format your lips."

Still you watch the golden lines...

War, I never knew your hands could move so quick
Your golden arrows sing
Your golden arrows sing
I'll format your lips

And with this being witnessed, our character now has learned
That fools are being taught to hate...
Now what's this you say about those sleeping children?
