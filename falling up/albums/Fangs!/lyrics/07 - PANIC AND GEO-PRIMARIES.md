[[PANIC]] AND [[GEO-PRIMARIES]]

Threatening, it's a [[open window|window open]]
Slide through like an [[aero plainn]] in the dark
And this is creeping, moving in control
Lasting to the twisted tune that led to
All the shaking in the dark
And [[under the floorboards|boards that lift]] to find [[mechanic souls]]
To know you are tangled
In the coral colored Queen's dress
As her figure leaves the ground
And this is creeping, moving on it's own
Shot out to the [[newest planet]]
Turned on the [[discoveratory]]'s light
And this is everyone who watched, displayed
Breathing in the dark, there finding where you are

In and out of sleep
I'm on the floor
I'm [[poison|spinning circles]], bloody circles
Can you see that everything has changed again?
Now what have I heard them speak as the evening candle flickered?
