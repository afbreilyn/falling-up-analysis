If you would untie the knots on your boats
I promise you that I could lie
[[Neptuenn]] has changed and I needed to loose
The rest of the bodies at sea
I have waited for too long, for too long

Downstairs, I heard everyone speak so soft
What plans they had made to bend their [[arms]]

Several more traps that I set to speed
Poles that would twist every limb
Several more marble and curving displays
Rise up the Gardens in fate

Downstairs, I heard everyone speak so soft
What plans they had made to bend their [[arms]]

Dreams I have always
Dreams I have always had
Lightning across walls
I knew you had to last
Lift up and see your death

---

And so our character escapes that dreary house as silently as possible
But only to find the Neon City...
