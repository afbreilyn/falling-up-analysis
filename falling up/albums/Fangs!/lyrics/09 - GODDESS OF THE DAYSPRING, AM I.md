I have found
Gears under the water
Crossed the streets of [[Acheron]]
To the docks that tilted up
Towards the lines
And now I'm in and out of sleep

Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?
Still I run my hands over your dress

I have found seas under the floorboards
I have stood above the wooden planks
Crossed the wandering walls to find
None of there wars!

Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?
Still I run my hands over your dress

Some of us have seen
The Golden Arrows poised
Arc across the courts
Turns us pale

Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?
Still I run my hands over your dress

And our character will never forget what has happened to that city
Pushed down like a strain of sick to the muddy banks...
