GODDESS OF THE DAYSPRING, AM I

I have found
[[Gears under the water]]
Crossed the streets of [[Acheron]]
To the docks that tilted up
Towards the lines
And now I'm in and out of sleep

Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?
Still I run my hands over your dress

I have found seas [[under the floorboards]]
I have stood above the wooden planks
Crossed the wandering walls to find
None of their wars!

Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?
Still I run my hands over your dress

Some of us have seen
The [[golden arrows]] [[poised]]
Arc across the [[plaints|courts]]
[[poison|Turns us pale]]

Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?
Still I run my hands over your dress

--

And our character will never forget what has happened to that city
Pushed down like a strain of sick to the [[muddy banks]]...

Is there a connection between Goddess of Dayspring and the "God of Day" in [[To Thee My Darling by Ambrose Bierce]]?

same lyric as [[06 - THE KING'S GARDEN]]
