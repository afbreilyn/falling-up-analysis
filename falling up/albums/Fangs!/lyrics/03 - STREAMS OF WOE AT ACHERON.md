STREAMS OF WOE AT [[Acheron | ACHERON]]

Turn away I'll pull the [[fangs]] out
[[poison|Spinning room it's getting dark]]

This is the [[green lift]], this is the archer
You never say that
This is the [[green lift]], this is the archer

This starry night, the blue of seas
Are lifted off the ground
So [[poised]] and still, the figures hold
That I will not be found

Turn away the [[Islet]] spiders
[[Gloaming]] pulse, the [[Siletzs]] [[stole]]

This is the [[green lift]], this is the archer

This starry night, the blue of seas
Are lifted off the ground
So [[poised]] and still, the figures hold
That I will not be found

This is the [[green lift]], this is the archer

This starry night, the blue of seas
Are lifted off the ground
So [[poised]] and still, the figures hold
That I will not be found

And on towards the fortress...
