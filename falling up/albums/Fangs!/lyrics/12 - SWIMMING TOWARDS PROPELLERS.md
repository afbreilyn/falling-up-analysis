SWIMMING TOWARDS PROPELLERS

Under the galaxy, the whole
And over the casting and the [[ROE]]
You work the turning world
[[golden arrows]]
Slipping further away from me
[[golden arrows]]
Slipping young ones in darker sleeps
Out of the shutters and the sills
And within the mourning and the chills
You work the [[turning world]]...

--

[[Down, down, down]]
Where are the stirrings of old?
I knew you had to last
But then the sound is heard...
