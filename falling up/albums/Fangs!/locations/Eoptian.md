The diagonal line represents the *Eoptian Age*, which is the duration allocated for man's existence in this garden cycle. It began with the creation of the Asu race 6,000 years before the Seffas season, and will conclude with man's extinction 6,000 years before the end of the Kosmon season (about 66,000 years from now). There will ensue an ice age (winter age) and the present earth garden will be over.
