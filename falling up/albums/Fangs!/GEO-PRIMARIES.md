Whenever I read this I assumed it meant something political: "geo" as in "geographic" and "primaries" as in "election" or something.

### GEO Orbits?

BUT it seems more possible that it is referencing GEO orbits.

A geostationary orbit, also referred to as a geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO). [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit)

For example, [this paper](https://www.agi.com/getmedia/d56ede5a-efe7-48de-af8b-c122117496af/A-Description-of-Filters-for-Minimizing-the-Time-Required-for-Orbital-Conjunction-Computations.pdf?ext=.pdf)) references "GEO Primaries" as compared to LEO (Low Earth Orbiting) or HEO (Highly Eccentric Orbits) primaries.

"Orbital conjunctions are identified through the examination of pairs of trajectories of orbiting objects. The goal of the process is to find all conjunctions between a set of objects of interest, referred to as **primary** objects, and the set of all cataloged orbiting objects, referred to as secondary objects."


### Group on Earth Observations?

The GEO Plenary

The GEO Plenary is the main body of designated representatives of the Members and Participating Organizations of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), with Members holding decision-making authority.  It is the **GEOâ€™s primary** decision-making body.  The GEO Plenary meets at least once annually. [ref](https://www.earthobservations.org/governance.php)
