In a land not unlike out own, a city witnessed a strange occurrence- the cloth that the children slept in was weaved in [[poison]] golden thread. If teh thread had touched the children's skin for much longer, they would be sure to fall into a deep sleep and never wake up. The city spared no time as they hoped to rid of the threads as soon as possible. In there plans, they tied up the threads in a large shoot and attached one thousand arrows on strings to the end of the shoot. Then, with a thousand of their strongest archers, they shot the [[poison]] threads up, up, up towards the nearest planet [[Neptuenn]].

A thousand years later...

Screams in the night- the city wakes to find their poor innocent children stuck deep with sharp [[golden arrows]]. All of the children lay silently with great arrows sticking out of their bodies. The people assume there must have been [[poison]] on the tips of the arrows and in the cities most desperate attempt to find those responsible for this atrocity, they sent out their most ambitious traveler and drifter to search the land. He is an adventurer, he is the hero. But as his attempts to find any answers while traveling the land had failed, he received word from the city that he must board a space craft at the space station [[Forum A]], located on Eoptian Island to blast off to the neatest planet [[Neptuenn]]. As the first from his planet to journey to this mysterious [[Neptuenn]], he departs in a zealous quest to search for the answers to this great riddle and find help for the sleeping children.

The story of our hero begins as he crash lands into a great sea on this mystic planet called [[Neptuenn]]. We follow along on his quest as he embarks to discorver the history of the planet, and just like anytime one travels to a distant land, he is shocked to notice just how strange the place that he comes from really is.
