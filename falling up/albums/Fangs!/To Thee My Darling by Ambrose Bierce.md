## The Poem

TO THEE, MY DARLING
The heliotrope's fragrant breath—
The subtle sweet of jasmine on the evening air—
The flowery mead, all radiant
With sympathetic pleasure
From the glowing kiss with which
The God of Day salutes its lovely face—
The whispering, snowy surf, wherewith
Old Ocean in his kindliest mood
Murmurs soft secrets to the willing sands—
The mingled joy and anguish thrilling us
In the weird [[plaints]] of Schubert—
Great Rossini's heaven-born strains—
All graceful, lovely things,
Lifting my soul to beatific state,—
Mnemosyne with flowery fetters
Binds to thee, my darling.

San Francisco News Letter and California Advertiser 20 ( February 26, 1870): 8.

## About the poem

> His courtship of a beautiful California heiress, Mary Ellen ("Mollie") Day, is reflected in the uncollected poems "To Thee, My Darling," with its charming pun on Mollie's last name, and "Serenade," with "Rosalie" perhaps being the first.  Ambrose and Mollie were married on December 25, 1871, and in the spring of 1872, they left San Francisco for London.

*Poems of Ambrose Bierce* 
By Ambrose Bierce

> A few of his earliest verses are little love poems inspired by his courtship of and marriage to Mary Ellen Day. The addressee of "Rosalie" (1869, signed only "B"), though called the persona's "blithesome daughter," is invited to let her "primrose spring" rejuvenate autumnal being. In "Too Thee, My Darling", (1870, unsigned but attributed to Bierce), the poet calls himself "The God of Day" as his kisses her "lovely face".  In "Oneiromancy" (1886) his persona awakens and sadly sees his "love / Conceal a letter in her glove"; tragically, two years later Bierce found love letters from another man in his wife's possession and irrationally walked out on her forever.

## Ambrose Bierce

(bolding by Anne)

Ambrose Bierce is one of the most colorful figures in American literary history. A writer whose Devil's Dictionary remains the delight of misanthropes and fans of satire throughout the English-speaking world, he was also a master of the short story form. From the late 1860s through the early 1900s, he worked as a journalist, gaining wide renown in the 1890s and 1900s as a satirical columnist for William Randolph Hearst's chain of newspapers. In 1913 Bierce traveled to Mexico and joined Pancho Villa's army as an observer. **He disappeared late that year and his fate has been a matter of dispute ever since.** The poems that Bierce wrote throughout his career are less well known than his stories, journalistic pieces, and aphoristic observations on human folly. Nevertheless, his work as a poet, as critic Donald Sidney-Fryer has argued, "clearly merits the attention of the discriminating lover and student of poetry." Varied in form and subject matter, most of his poems are (not surprisingly) satires. This volume contains a generous selection of Bierce's poems; they are alternately ironic, melancholy, bitter, and wickedly amusing. There are also fifteen essays and letters on poetry, poets, and such topics as "Wit and Humor" and "The Passing of Satire." Certainly there have been few authors more intimately familiar with wit and satire than the brilliant, iconoclastic Bierce. As editor M. E. Grenander makes plain in her introduction, both are abundantly present in this collection of "some of the most remarkable verse in American literary history."
